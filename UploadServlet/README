This surflet was developed and tested with
* Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers, Version: Juno Service Release 2 in combination with a 
* Tomcat v7.0 server and a
* mysql Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.29 database.
You find the database settings in the file MobileSensing/UploadServlet/liveandgov/WebContent/META-INF/context.xml

How to deploy a new version of the servlet:

1)  Change the Java code or add binary files. Commit your changes to github.
1.1)  To provide a new version of the Android data collection app:
      Go to the LiveAndGovCollector eclipse project and export the app as liveandgov.apk
      Copy the new binary to the folder MobileSensing/UploadServlet/liveandgov/WebContent/static (this is inside your surflet eclipse project)
2.) Export the surflet: Right click on the surflet project and choose Export -> WAR file
3.) Copy the exported WAR file to the mobile-sensing server:
    scp liveandgov.war mobile-sensing.west.uni-koblenz.de:/home/chrisschaefer/liveandgov.war
4.) Login on the mobile-sensing server:
    ssh mobile-sensing.west.uni-koblenz.de
5.) Deploy the new WAR file (you have to be super user):
    sudo cp liveandgov.war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/liveandgov.war
6.) Check the changes on the live system at the URL
    http://mobile-sensing.west.uni-koblenz.de:8080/liveandgov/
7.) Check the logs if everything went well (logged in on the mobile-sensing server):
    sudo tail -f /var/lib/tomcat7/logs/catalina.out
    sudo tail -f /var/lib/tomcat7/logs/localhost_access_log.2013-05-21.txt
